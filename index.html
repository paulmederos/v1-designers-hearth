        <h1>Meet, share, &amp; learn from local designers in the SF Bay Area.</h1>
        <p>The Bay Area is for makers and designers. We rally under the banners of UX, interaction, product, behavior, visual, and dozens of interdisciplinary titles that revolve around designing experiences (from software to the physical) that help people.</p>

        <p>You should join this group if you love what you do, thrive on creating experiences that other people fall in love with, and want to connect with other passionate interactive designers in the Palo Alto / Mountain View / Los Altos area. Call yourself a designer? Check. Web/mobile dev? Nice. Startup founder? Cool. As long as you care about design, you'll fit in.</p>

        <p>This group is focused on sharing intimate experiences with other designers and makers. We're talking 6-10 person meetups, grabbing dinner together to talk design, our industry, and our personal lives. We like to think of it as Twitter, but offline, and without the trolls.</p>
